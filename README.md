# Bonus Ball

## Description:
A simple ball simulation. This project incorporates concepts learned within the beginning weeks of the MITxPro progam, using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Presenting the Bonus Ball Challenge. Features include:
 1. Side to Side Button 
 2. Up and Down Button
 3. Ball Color Change Button
 4. A Pink Ball- (This is centered in the middle of the page and is the object that executes the commands of each button.) 

## Usage: 
Clicking the 'Side to Side' button, it initiates the movement of the ball, moving it left to right. Clicking the 'Up and Down Button' sets the pink ball in motion to move vertically. Selecting either of these two buttons more than once will increase the speed of the ball. Selecting both buttons simultaneously will set the ball in different directions and ocassionaly off screen. Refreshing the webpage will set it back to its intial state. Clicking 'Color Change' alternates the appearence of the ball between eight different colors, changing with each mouse-click. The ball color can also change while in motion. 

## Roadmap: 
Future improvements will be to update current features and add more animation.
